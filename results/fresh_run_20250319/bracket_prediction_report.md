# NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament 2025 Prediction Report
Generated on: 2025-03-19 21:12:42

## Tournament Champion: Duke
Confidence: 50%
Reasoning: 1. Duke's superior offensive efficiency (1st nationally) and defensive rating (4th nationally) gives them a slight edge over Auburn, who has shown recent vulnerability with 3 losses in their last 4 games.
2. Duke's previous head-to-head victory (84-78) this season demonstrates their ability to match up well against Auburn's style of play.
3. While both teams have impressive metrics, Duke's more consistent performance throughout the season (31-3 vs Auburn's 30-4) and better stability in recent games gives them a marginal advantage in what projects to be an extremely close championship game. Note: Confidence reduced due to historical upset patterns in 1-1 seed matchups.

## Final Four Teams
- Auburn vs Texas Tech - Winner: Auburn
- Duke vs Houston - Winner: Duke

## Predicted Upsets
### Baylor (#9) over Mississippi State (#8)
Round: First Round
Confidence: 50%
Reasoning: 1. Despite their lower seed, Baylor ranks higher in blended power ratings (25th vs 32nd) and has proven more capable against elite competition, with six wins against top-15 KenPom teams. Mississippi State is 0-8 against top-16 NET teams.

### Michigan (#5) over Texas A&M (#4)
Round: Second Round
Confidence: 50%
Reasoning: 1. Michigan's elite defensive rebounding (#8 nationally) should neutralize Texas A&M's primary strength of offensive rebounding (#1), effectively eliminating A&M's key advantage of second-chance points.
2. Michigan's superior interior presence and size advantage matches up particularly well against A&M's poor shooting efficiency (293rd in 2-point shooting, 317th in 3-point shooting), forcing A&M to rely on a strength (offensive rebounds) that Michigan is uniquely positioned to counter.
3. Michigan's strong performance against mid-tier competition (7-0 vs teams ranked 80-180) and demonstrated ability to control games through interior dominance aligns well against A&M's vulnerabilities, while expert consensus and betting markets also favor Michigan (-2.5). Note: Confidence reduced due to historical upset patterns in 5-4 seed matchups.

### Texas Tech (#3) over St. John's (#2)
Round: Sweet 16
Confidence: 50%
Reasoning: 1. Texas Tech's balanced offensive attack (80.9 PPG, 16.6 APG) gives them multiple scoring options against St. John's elite defense, while St. John's poor 3-point shooting (30.4%) limits their ability to keep pace
2. Texas Tech's experience in the highly competitive Big 12 conference (with quality wins against Houston and Arizona) better prepares them for tournament pressure compared to St. John's schedule
3. While St. John's has the defensive edge, Texas Tech's proven ability to adapt to different game styles and superior offensive efficiency should be enough to overcome St. John's defensive strength in a close game Note: Confidence reduced due to historical upset patterns in 3-2 seed matchups.

### Drake (#11) over Missouri (#6)
Round: First Round
Confidence: 58%
Reasoning: 1. Drake's exceptional efficiency metrics (48.1% FG percentage) and strong defensive performance (holding opponents to 58.4 points) match up well against Missouri's recent offensive struggles.
2. Drake's methodical pace and excellent ball control (1.2 assist-to-turnover ratio) should help neutralize Missouri's preferred up-tempo style, especially with Bennett Stirtz's steady floor leadership.
3. Historical trends favor the upset (39% success rate for #11 seeds), and Drake's impressive 30-3 record suggests they're particularly strong for their seed, while Missouri's recent form (losing 4 of last 5 regular season games) raises concerns.

### Colorado State (#12) over Memphis (#5)
Round: First Round
Confidence: 50%
Reasoning: 1. Memphis's key vulnerability matches Colorado State's strengths - the Rams' efficient offense and three-point shooting (42.8%) can exploit Memphis's defensive weaknesses, while Tyrese Hunter's injury issues further compromise Memphis's defense. Note: Confidence reduced due to historical upset patterns in 5-12 seed matchups.

### Liberty (#12) over Oregon (#5)
Round: First Round
Confidence: 50%
Reasoning: 1. Liberty's superior shooting efficiency (6th in FG%, 6th in 3PT%) and strong defense (10th in points allowed) match the profile of successful #12 seed upset teams historically.
2. While Oregon has faced tougher competition, Liberty's balanced scoring attack (7 players averaging 8+ points) and elite ball security (9.4 turnovers per game) suggest they can handle Oregon's defensive pressure.
3. The historical 35.3% success rate of #12 seeds, combined with Liberty's momentum (winning CUSA championship) and strong statistical profile, make them a prime candidate for one of the typical 1-2 twelve-seed upsets per tournament.

### UConn (#8) over Florida (#1)
Round: Second Round
Confidence: 70%
Reasoning: 1. UConn's recent tournament success (2024 champions) and proven ability to perform under pressure gives them a significant edge, despite being the lower seed. Their tournament experience and coaching stability under Dan Hurley is particularly valuable in high-stakes games.
