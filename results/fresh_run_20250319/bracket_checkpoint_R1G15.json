The statistical mismatch is significant - Michigan State's 6th-ranked defense and superior rebounding (8th nationally in defensive rebounding) should neutralize Bryant's primary strength of offensive rebounding.\n2. While Bryant has offensive firepower (82.4 ppg), they've struggled badly against top competition, losing by large margins to KenPom top-100 teams. Michigan State's elite defense and tournament-tested coaching under Tom Izzo present an even greater challenge.\n3. Historical data shows #15 seeds win only 6.9% of the time, and Bryant's profile doesn't suggest they have the exceptional characteristics of past successful #15 seeds. Their struggles against strong rebounding teams (4-8 record) is particularly concerning against MSU's physicality.",
