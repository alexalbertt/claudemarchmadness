The statistical mismatch is significant - Michigan State's 6th-ranked defense and superior rebounding (8th nationally in defensive rebounding) should neutralize Bryant's primary strength of offensive rebounding.\n2. While Bryant has offensive firepower (82.4 ppg), they've struggled badly against top competition, losing by large margins to KenPom top-100 teams. Michigan State's elite defense and tournament-tested coaching under Tom Izzo present an even greater challenge.\n3. Historical data shows #15 seeds win only 6.9% of the time, and Bryant's profile doesn't suggest they have the exceptional characteristics of past successful #15 seeds. Their struggles against strong rebounding teams (4-8 record) is particularly concerning against MSU's physicality.",

While Omaha has strong perimeter shooting (36.7%), St. John's defensive pressure and significant talent advantage (led by Big East Player of the Year RJ Luis) should overwhelm Omaha's offense, especially given the massive gap in strength of schedule between Big East and Summit League competition.\n3. The game being played in Providence gives St. John's a virtual home court advantage, and the 2025 tournament's historically large statistical gap between #2 and #15 seeds (+26.84) suggests this particular year is less conducive to major upsets in this seed matchup.",
